       <h2>Back-Story</h2>
       <p>
        The animosity between Sasuke and Itachi finds its roots in the tragic massacre of the Uchiha clan, perpetrated by Itachi.

This heinous act leaves a young Sasuke scarred and fuelled with an unquenchable thirst for vengeance against his elder brother. The narrative builds up to their confrontation with Sasuke’s relentless pursuit of power to avenge his clan’s annihilation.
The face-off between the brothers is a high-tension, emotionally charged battle, laden with a mix of resentment, anguish, and the desire for retribution.

As the fight progresses, a dazzling display of advanced techniques and Sharingan abilities is unleashed. The exchange of Amaterasu, Susanoo, and other unique Uchiha clan abilities showcases the profound power and skill possessed by both brothers.


Here are some of the attacks and techniques used by both characters during this intense confrontation.

        <p>
           <b> Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) </b>was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
               <b> Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) </b> is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja, and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills but eventually grows dissatisfied with his progress. He defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge and master the Cursed Seal of Heaven. His years of seeking vengeance and the actions that followed became increasingly demanding, irrational, and isolated from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (支う影, Sasaukage, literally meaning: Supporting Shadow).
